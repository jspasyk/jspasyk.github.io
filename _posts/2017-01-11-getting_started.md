Just getting started with testing whether Jekyll will work for a development group's documentation. With a small bit of extra markup, all kinds 
of files can be automatically generated into a website. Each commit in GIT to designated files will result in the web site being automatically 
updated. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. (so far!)
